Description: Neural style transfer is the process of using the style of one 
    image and the content of another to produce a new image (Gatys, Ecker, 
    Bethge (2015) <arXiv:1508.06576>). Implementing style transfer often 
    involves multiple iterations to dial in the desired effect. This package
    aims to guide the user through that process.
